# MS-ICS Capstone Seminar Final Project

## Class Background
[ICT 4902 - Capstone Seminar](https://universitycollege.du.edu/courses/coursesdetail.cfm?degreecode=ict&coursenum=4902) is a required concentration course for University of Denver - University College's [Master of Science in Information and Communications Technology](https://universitycollege.du.edu/ict/degree/masters/web-design-and-development-online/degreeid/400). The Capstone Seminar is a graduate seminar in which students utilize the knowledge and skills gained through the degree program to create a culminating work that critically addresses a problem in their degree field of study. The students produce a Capstone of 7000-8000 words that presents a position on a relevant problem, supports the position with professional and academic literature, analyzes and tests the proposed solution, and discusses the findings as related to the field of study. _No primary research is allowed_.
