# MS-ICS Capstone Seminar Final Project

## Class Background
[ICT 4902 - Capstone Seminar](https://universitycollege.du.edu/courses/coursesdetail.cfm?degreecode=ict&coursenum=4902) is a required concentration course for University of Denver - University College's [Master of Science in Information and Communications Technology](https://universitycollege.du.edu/ict/degree/masters/web-design-and-development-online/degreeid/400). The Capstone Seminar is a graduate seminar in which students utilize the knowledge and skills gained through the degree program to create a culminating work that critically addresses a problem in their degree field of study. The students produce a Capstone of 7000-8000 words that presents a position on a relevant problem, supports the position with professional and academic literature, analyzes and tests the proposed solution, and discusses the findings as related to the field of study. No primary research is allowed. 

## Project Information
My [final project](https://github.com/Feldbot/MS-ICT-Capstone-Seminar/blob/master/Web-based%20Data%20Visualization_Daniel%20Feldman.pdf) examines data visualization from the viewpoint of those who produce visualizations for the web, namely designers and developers. The topic interests me as I've produced technical data visualizations in print as a graphic designer and illustrator, however, while learning web development I became curious how producing and distributing visualizations happens over the web. Through basic research——primarily literature review——I focused on discovering if best practices existed in data visualization production, and if there was then an optimal way to distribute them over the web. 

## Abstract
Designers and developers struggle with finding effective workflow solutions when producing web-based data visualizations. Conceptual design problems surface in transforming raw data into effective visual messages. Technical development issues arise in choosing tools and
frameworks to construct and distribute work. By examining the role of design guidelines and best practices to shape effective work, and assessing the benefits of leading data visualization production platforms, workflow optimization is possible. Solving these problems can save time and effort in production, and create improved work. This outcome benefits designers and developers, project stakeholders, and
consumers. This research explains how the application of design best practices and guidelines, and choosing a web-standards framework for
development and distribution can create effective and portable data visualizations.
