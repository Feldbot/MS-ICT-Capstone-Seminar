# MS-ICT Capstone Seminar Final Project

## Class Background
[ICT 4902 - Capstone Seminar](https://universitycollege.du.edu/courses/coursesdetail.cfm?degreecode=ict&coursenum=4902) is a required concentration course for University of Denver - University College's [Master of Science in Information and Communications Technology](https://universitycollege.du.edu/ict/degree/masters/web-design-and-development-online/degreeid/400). The Capstone Seminar is a graduate seminar in which students utilize the knowledge and skills gained through the degree program to create a culminating work that critically addresses a problem in their degree field of study. The students produce a Capstone of 7000-8000 words that presents a position on a relevant problem, supports the position with professional and academic literature, analyzes and tests the proposed solution, and discusses the findings as related to the field of study. No primary research is allowed. 

## Project Information
My [final project](https://github.com/Feldbot/MS-ICT-Capstone-Seminar/blob/master/Web-based%20Data%20Visualization_Daniel%20Feldman.pdf) examines data visualization from the viewpoint of those who produce visualizations for the web, namely designers and developers. The topic interests me as I've produced data-rich graphics in print, however, while learning web development I became curious how people produce and distribute data visualizations over the web. Through basic research and literature review, I focused on discovering if best practices existed in data visualization production, and if there was then an optimal way to distribute them online.
